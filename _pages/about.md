I am an incoming neurosurgery resident at UCSF. Prior to this, I completed my MD/PhD at the University of Washington through the MSTP program in 2021. My PhD was in bioengineering in the laboratories of Dr. Jeffrey Ojemann in the department of Neurosurgery and Dr. Rajesh Rao from the department of Computer Science and Engineering. My PhD research work focused on engineering direct electrical stimulation of human sensorimotor cortex. To do this, I worked with patients that are implanted with electrodes in their brains for clinical care of epilepsy and movement disorders such as Parkinson’s and Essential Tremor.  I received bachelor’s and master’s degrees in biomedical engineering from the University of Michigan. I seek to advance the interface of neurosurgery and engineering.
