	abstract = {Objective: Electrical stimulation of the human brain is commonly used for eliciting and inhibiting neural activity for clinical diagnostics, modifying abnormal neural circuit function for therapeutics, and interrogating cortical connectivity. However, recording electrical signals with concurrent stimulation results in dominant electrical artifacts that mask the neural signals of interest. Here we develop a method to reproducibly and robustly recover neural activity during concurrent stimulation. We concentrate on signal recovery across an array of electrodes without channel-wise fine-tuning of the algorithm. Our goal includes signal recovery with trains of stimulation pulses, since repeated, high-frequency pulses are often required to induce desired effects in both therapeutic and research domains. We have made all of our code and data publicly available. Approach: We developed an algorithm that automatically detects templates of artifacts across many channels of recording, creating a dictionary of learned templates using unsupervised clustering. The artifact template that best matches each individual artifact pulse is subtracted to recover the underlying activity. To assess the success of our method, we focus on whether it extracts physiologically interpretable signals from real recordings. Main Results: We demonstrate our signal recovery approach on invasive electrophysiologic recordings from human subjects during stimulation. We show the recovery of meaningful neural signatures in both electrocorticographic (ECoG) arrays and deep brain stimulation (DBS) recordings. In addition, we compared cortical responses induced by the stimulation of primary somatosensory (S1) by natural peripheral touch, as well as motor cortex activity with and without concurrent S1 stimulation. Significance: Our work will enable future advances in neural engineering with simultaneous stimulation and recording.},

	abstract = {Electrocorticographic brain computer interfaces (ECoG-BCIs) offer tremendous opportunities for restoring function in individuals suffering from neurological damage and for advancing basic neuroscience knowledge. ECoG electrodes are already commonly used clinically for monitoring epilepsy and have greater spatial specificity in recording neuronal activity than techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG). Much work to date in the field has focused on using ECoG signals recorded from cortex as control outputs for driving end effectors. An equally important but less explored application of an ECoG-BCI is directing input into cortex using ECoG electrodes for direct electrical stimulation (DES). Combining DES with ECoG recording enables a truly bidirectional BCI, where information is both read from and written to the brain. We discuss the advantages and opportunities, as well as the barriers and challenges presented by using DES in an ECoG-BCI. In this article, we review ECoG electrodes, the physics and physiology of DES, and the use of electrical stimulation of the brain for the clinical treatment of disorders such as epilepsy and Parkinson's disease. We briefly discuss some of the translational, regulatory, financial, and ethical concerns regarding ECoG-BCIs. Next, we describe the use of ECoG-based DES for providing sensory feedback and for probing and modifying cortical connectivity. We explore future directions, which may draw on invasive animal studies with penetrating and surface electrodes as well as non-invasive stimulation methods such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). We conclude by describing enabling technologies, such as smaller ECoG electrodes for more precise targeting of cortical areas, signal processing strategies for simultaneous stimulation and recording, and computational modeling and algorithms for tailoring stimulation to each individual brain.},

	abstract = {Non-destructive monitoring of engineered tissues is needed for translation of these products from the lab to the clinic. In this study, non-invasive, high resolution spectral ultrasound imaging (SUSI) was used to monitor the differentiation of MC3T3 pre-osteoblasts seeded within collagen hydrogels. SUSI was used to measure the diameter, concentration and acoustic attenuation of scatterers within such constructs cultured in either control or osteogenic medium over 21 days. Conventional biochemical assays were used on parallel samples to determine DNA content and calcium deposition. Construct volume and morphology were accurately imaged using ultrasound. Cell diameter was estimated to be approximately 12.5-15.5 µm using SUSI, which corresponded well to measurements of fluorescently stained cells. The total number of cells per construct assessed by quantitation of DNA content decreased from 5.6±2.4×10(4) at day 1 to 0.9±0.2×10(4) at day 21. SUSI estimation of the equivalent number of acoustic scatters showed a similar decreasing trend, except at day 21 in the osteogenic samples, which showed a marked increase in both scatterer number and acoustic impedance, suggestive of mineral deposition by the differentiating MC3T3 cells. Estimation of calcium content by SUSI was 41.7±11.4 µg/ml, which agreed well with the biochemical measurement of 38.7±16.7 µg/ml. Color coded maps of parameter values were overlaid on B-mode images to show spatiotemporal changes in cell diameter and calcium deposition. This study demonstrates the use of non-destructive ultrasound imaging to provide quantitative information on the number and differentiated state of cells embedded within 3D engineered constructs, and therefore presents a valuable tool for longitudinal monitoring of engineered tissue development.},

Visualizing a connectivity matrix, looking for trends and patterns, and dynamically manipulating these values is a challenge for scientists from diverse fields, including neuroscience and genomics. In particular, high-dimensional neural data include those acquired via electroencephalography (EEG), electrocorticography (ECoG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and functional MRI. Neural connectivity data contains multivariate attributes for each edge between different brain regions, which motivated our lightweight, open source, easy-to-use visualization tool for the exploration of these connectivity matrices to highlight connections of interest. Here we present a client-side, mobile-compatible visualization tool written entirely in HTML5/JavaScript that allows in-browser manipulation of user-defined files for exploration of brain connectivity. Visualizations can highlight different aspects of the data simultaneously across different dimensions. Input files are in JSON format, and custom Python scripts have been written to parse MATLAB or Python data files into JSON-loadable format. We demonstrate the analysis of connectivity data acquired via human ECoG recordings as a domain-specific implementation of our application. We envision applications for this interactive tool in fields seeking to visualize pairwise connectivity.},

We demonstrate that neural dynamics during visually-guided imagined grasp shaping can encode intended movement. We apply Procrustes analysis and LASSO regression to achieve 72\% accuracy (chance = 25\%) in distinguishing between visually-guided imagined grasp trajectories. Further, we can predict the stage of grasp shaping in the form of elapsed time from start of trial (R 2 =0.4). Our approach contributes to more accurate single-trial decoding of higher-level movement goals and the phase of grasping movements in individuals not trained with brain-computer interfaces. We also find that the overall time-varying trajectory structure of imagined movements tend to be consistent within individuals, and that transient trajectory deviations within trials return to the task-dependent trajectory mean. These overall findings may contribute to the further understanding of the cortical dynamics of human motor imagery.},

	abstract = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is a clinically effective tool for treating medically refractory Parkinson’s disease (PD), but its neural mechanisms remain debated. Previous work has demonstrated that STN DBS results in evoked potentials (EPs) in the primary motor cortex (M1), suggesting that modulation of cortical physiology may be involved in its therapeutic effects. Due to technical challenges presented by high-amplitude DBS artifacts, these EPs are often measured in response to low-frequency stimulation, which is generally ineffective at PD symptom management. This study aims to characterize STN-to-cortex EPs seen during clinically relevant high-frequency STN DBS for PD. Intraoperatively, we applied STN DBS to 6 PD patients while recording electrocorticography (ECoG) from an electrode strip over the ipsilateral central sulcus. Using recently published techniques, we removed large stimulation artifacts to enable quantification of STN-to-cortex EPs. Two cortical EPs were observed – one synchronized with DBS onset and persisting during ongoing stimulation, and one immediately following DBS offset, here termed the “start” and the “end” EPs respectively. The start EP is, to our knowledge, the first long-latency cortical EP reported during ongoing high-frequency DBS. The start and end EPs differ in magnitude (p {\textless} 0.05) and latency (p {\textless} 0.001), and the end, but not the start, EP magnitude has a significant relationship (p {\textless} 0.001, adjusted for random effects of subject) to ongoing high gamma (80–150 Hz) power during the EP. These contrasts may suggest mechanistic or circuit differences in EP production during the two time periods. This represents a potential framework for relating DBS clinical efficacy to the effects of a variety of stimulation parameters on EPs.},

Traditional electrocorticographic features (spikes, ictal onset changes, and recently high-frequency oscillations [HFOs]) rely on the presence of transient features that occur within or near epileptogenic cortex. Here the authors report on a novel corticography feature of epileptogenic cortex—covariation of high-gamma and beta frequency band power profiles. Band-limited power was measured from each recording site based on native physiological signal differences without relying on clinical ictal or interictal epileptogenic features. In this preliminary analysis, frequency windowed power correlation appears to be a specific marker of the epileptogenic zone. The authors’ overall aim was to validate this observation with the location of the eventual resection and outcome.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/div{\textgreater}{\textless}div id="" class="section"{\textgreater}{\textless}h3 class="abstractTitle text-title my-1" id="d1053e6"{\textgreater}METHODS{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}The authors conducted a retrospective analysis of 13 adult patients who had undergone electrocorticography for surgical planning at their center. They quantified the correlation of high-gamma (70–200 Hz) and beta (12–18 Hz) band frequency power per electrode site during a cognitive task. They used a sliding window method to correlate the power of smoothed, Hilbert-transformed high-gamma and beta bands. They then compared positive and negative correlations between power in the high-gamma and beta bands in the setting of a hand versus a tongue motor task as well as within the resting state. Significant positive correlations were compared to surgically resected areas and outcomes based on reviewed records.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/div{\textgreater}{\textless}div id="" class="section"{\textgreater}{\textless}h3 class="abstractTitle text-title my-1" id="d1053e9"{\textgreater}RESULTS{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Positive high-gamma and beta correlations appeared to predict the area of eventual resection and, preliminarily, surgical outcome independent of spike detection.

	abstract = {Background Converging literatures suggest that deep brain stimulation (DBS) in Parkinson's disease affects multiple circuit mechanisms. One proposed mechanism is the normalization of primary motor cortex (M1) pathophysiology via effects on the hyperdirect pathway. Objectives We hypothesized that DBS would reduce the current intensity necessary to modulate motor-evoked potentials from focally applied direct cortical stimulation (DCS). Methods Intraoperative subthalamic DBS, DCS, and preoperative diffusion tensor imaging data were acquired in 8 patients with Parkinson's disease. Results In 7 of 8 patients, DBS significantly reduced the M1 DCS current intensity required to elicit motor-evoked potentials. This neuromodulation was specific to select DBS bipolar configurations. In addition, the volume of activated tissue models of these configurations were significantly associated with overlap of the hyperdirect pathway. Conclusions DBS reduces the current necessary to elicit a motor-evoked potential using DCS. This supports a circuit mechanism of DBS effectiveness, potentially involving the hyperdirect pathway that speculatively may underlie reductions in hypokinetic abnormalities in Parkinson's disease. © 2020 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society},
